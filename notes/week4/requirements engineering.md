# Requirements Engineering

Requirements Engineering (RE) is in the step of "Software Specification".

```py
SOFTWARE PROCESS = {
  "Software Specification", # we are here now ðŸ¤£
  "Software Design and Implementation", 
  "Software Validation", 
  "Software Evolution"
}
```

## Content
- USER REQUIREMENTS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- FUNCTIONAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- how requirements may be organized in a software requirements document
- the principal requirements engineering activities of 
  - elicitation
  - analysis
  - validation
  - and the relationships between these activities

## USER REQUIREMENTS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- High-level description or detail description
- Different level of details serve different purpose. User requirements and system requirements
  - User requirements
    - high-level 
    - natural language
    - diagrams
    - Statements to constraint of a system
  - System requirements
    - more detailed
    - functions
    - services
    - operational constraints

## e.g. User and system requirements

## Stakeholder types
- End users
- System managers
- System owners
- External stakeholders

## Functional and non-functional requirements

- Functional requirements
  - Statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations.
  - May state what the system should not do.
- Non-functional requirements
  - Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc.
  - Often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services.
- Domain requirements
  - Constraints on the system from the domain of operation
