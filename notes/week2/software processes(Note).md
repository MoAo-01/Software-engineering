## 不同的开发形式
- For a critical systems, a very structured development process is required.
- 对于关键系统，需要非常结构化的开发过程。
- For business systems, with rapidly changing requirements, a less formal, flexible process is likely to be more effective
- 对于需求快速变化的业务系统，不太正式、灵活的流程可能更有效


## SOFTWARE PROCESS ACTIVITIES
Four activities that are fundamental to software engineering:
- Software specification 
- Software design and implementation 
- Software validation 
- Software evolution 
- 软件规格说明
- 软件开发
- 软件确认
- 软件演化

## 
- Software processes are complex and, there is no ideal process
- Software processes are categorized as either plan-driven or agile processes.
- 软件过程分为计划驱动或敏捷过程。
  - Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
  - 计划驱动的流程是所有流程活动都预先计划并根据该计划衡量进度的流程。
  - In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
  - 在敏捷流程中，计划是渐进式的，更容易更改流程以反映不断变化的客户需求。
